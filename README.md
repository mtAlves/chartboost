# Chartboost

**Note: Currently only Android platform is supported.**

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialization

Call `Chartboost.init;` during app initialization.

```dart
Chartboost.init('YOUR APP ID', 'YOUR APP SIGNATURE');
```

** OPTIONAL
Preload ads on your usersâ€™ devices to boost their experience! Ads will load faster when requested.
Do not call `showInterstitial` directly after `cacheInterstitial` for the same location, or the SDK will fail silently.

```dart
Chartboost.cacheInterstitial();
```

### 2. Show Interstitial Ad

```dart
 listener(ChartboostEventListener event) {
    print('EVENT: $event');
    if(event == ChartboostEventListener.didCacheInterstitial)
        print('Cached interstitial!');
 }
Chartboost.showInterstitial(listener: listener);
```
